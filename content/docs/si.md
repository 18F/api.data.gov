### [Open Access API](https://edan.si.edu/openaccess/apidocs/)

<p>On February 25, 2020, the Smithsonian launched Open Access, releasing 2.8 million 2D and 3D images and 173-years of staff-created data into the public domain as Creative Commons Zero. Open Access furthers the Smithsonian’s mission which has been the same since its founding in 1846: for the "increase and diffusion of knowledge." </p>

<p>The Open Access API was released as part of the launch allowing you to connect to the 2.8 million "open access” collections and corresponding metadata. This is a CC0 subset of the Smithsonian’s 155 million objects, 2.1 million library volumes and 156,000 cubic feet of archival collections held in 19 museums, 9 research centers, libraries, archives and the National Zoo. Digitization of collections is ongoing.</p>
