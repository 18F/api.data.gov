title: 3D Print Exchange
summary: The NIH 3D Print Exchange ("3DPX" for short) houses biomedically-relevant 3D models, which anyone can interact with in a browser-based viewer or download and print on a 3D printer. Our APIs allow developers to access this content – in both XML and JSON format – for integration into their own tools.
