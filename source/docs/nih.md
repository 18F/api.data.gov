# National Institutes of Health

### [3D Print Exchange](https://niaid.github.io/3dpx_api/)
The NIH 3D Print Exchange ("3DPX" for short) houses biomedically-relevant 3D models, which anyone can interact with in a browser-based viewer or download and print on a 3D printer. Our APIs allow developers to access this content – in both XML and JSON format – for integration into their own tools. 

### [Pillbox](http://pillbox.nlm.nih.gov/developer.html)
Pillbox's API provides access to a search system designed to identify unknown pills. Data and images for drug identification and reference, including 5,000+ unique pill images and prescription labels, are also available as bulk downloads.
