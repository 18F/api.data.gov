# Federal Communications Commission

### [Accessibility Clearinghouse](http://apps.fcc.gov/accessibilityclearinghouse/developers.html)
The 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act put into motion new requirements to ensure that everyone has access to communications as well as the ability to send and receive emergency information and services.

### [Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS)](https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/public-api-docs.html)
ECFS serves as the repository for official records in the FCC's docketed proceedings from 1992 to the present. The public can use ECFS to retrieve any document in the system, including selected pre-1992 documents.
