The API gateway servicing developer.nrel.gov APIs is experiencing intermittent outages. No other agency APIs are being affected.

::: update Resolved | 2019-02-21T22:49:28Z
Connectivity for developer.nrel.gov APIs has been restored. No other agency APIs were affected. developer.nrel.gov APIs may have been intermittently available during this outage, but full service is now restored. The cause of this was related to new infrastructure rollout and DNS changes that happened too early.
