## Onboarding a new API program

_This documents the steps that the api.data.gov team go through when onboarding a new API program._

1. Ask the client what the underlying API endpoint is.
2. Create an API backend for the API. Tell the client when it is done, including with a sample API call.
3. Create an API Scope and Admin Group for the new API.
4. Ask the API program who on their team should have admin access and who should have view-only analytics access.
5. Grant the proper access.
6. Tell the agency that:

- They need to embed the api key sign up form in their API docs. Describe the customizations that must happen.
- What contact info they want developers to use to get in touch with them, for our contact page and for their error messages.
- Restrict access to just our IP addresses.
- What else?
