### Summary

The creation of [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov) has been a tremendous success, promoting the adoption of the Digital Analytics Program and making its data substantially more useful and usable not just to the public but also to participating agencies. The potential and need for the api.data.gov program is similar.

### What would be public?

High-level data would be useful while not creating any problems for agencies or third party developers. Here is the proposed data to be made public:

- Number of hits per API program and agency
- Number of active developer keys per API program and agency
- Number of agencies using the service
- Number of API programs using the service
- Number of active developer keys system wide
- Number of hits system wide

For each of the above, we would want to show last 7 days, last 30 days, last month, and the month before.

### Next Steps

- Engage with agencies to discuss this effort.
- Create one or two mockups of the information.
- Set up feedback sessions to ask outside developers what would be interest.
- Create an MVP.
